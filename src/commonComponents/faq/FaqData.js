        answerText: "We design the lift in 3D modelling software after measuring your shaft. Then, import it into a 2D drawing, which is converted into Kanban cards. The production manager gives this process to the first workstation, followed by CNC bending, fabrication, and paint job. The product is then packaged and ready for delivery.",
